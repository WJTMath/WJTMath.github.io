title:  'Positive and Negative Units'
---

The study of arithmetic at its core is based around conbining **units**
together. 

# What is a Unit?

A **unit** is anything you want to keep track of! Footballs, dollars, apples...
anything you can name is its own type of unit. In order to do arithmetic on
units, they must all be of the same type. Two apples plus two dollars doesn't
make much sense.

Let the unit be represented by the <i class="far far-circle"></i> symbol.
(It's not an "official" symbol, just a visual for convenience.)
You are likely already familiar with expressing units using numbers.

<i class="far fa-circle"></i> = 1 <br>
<i class="far fa-circle"></i>
<i class="far fa-circle"></i> = 2 <br>
<i class="far fa-circle"></i>
<i class="far fa-circle"></i>
<i class="far fa-circle"></i> = 3

The **addition** operation and its symbol $$+$$  allows you to combine two
groups of units.

<i class="far fa-circle"></i>
<i class="far fa-circle"></i>
$${}+{}$$
<i class="far fa-circle"></i>
<i class="far fa-circle"></i>
<i class="far fa-circle"></i>
$${}={}$$
<i class="far fa-circle"></i>
<i class="far fa-circle"></i>
<i class="far fa-circle"></i>
<i class="far fa-circle"></i>
<i class="far fa-circle"></i> <br>
$$2 + 3 = 5$$

That's not much different from a simple tally, which you can find in human
history thousands of years ago. Two additions to the counting system will
greatly expand its utility: **zero** and **negative units**.

<i class="far fa-plus-square"></i> <i class="fas fa-minus-square"></i>
<i class="far fa-square"></i> <i class="fas fa-square"></i>
<i class="far fa-circle"></i> <i class="fas fa-circle"></i>
<i class="fas fa-dot-circle"></i>

# Zero and Negative Units

The concept of using **zero** (0) to represent "nothing" is somewhat recent in
history. We will define zero and **negative units** together in one statement.

<i class="far fa-circle"></i>
$${}+{}$$
<i class="fas fa-circle"></i>
$${}={}$$
0 <br>
$$1 + (-1) = 0$$

The prefix "$$-$$" on a number will denote an "opposite". For example, $$-1$$
means "the opposite of 1", or one negative unit. This can occur multiple times
but it is avoided when possible as it can be confusing. $$-(-1)$$ is "the
opposite of (the opposite of 1)" which is one positive unit.

# Principles of Addition

Using these definitions, several principles and properties of addition can be
found:

**Like signs stack up, opposite signs cancel.** 

**Secret: Order doesn't matter.** By using the chips this way, I have been
